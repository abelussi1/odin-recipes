<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour</li>

    <li>2 cups (396g) sugar</li>

    <li>3/4 cup (63g) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>

    <li>2 teaspoons (8g) baking powder</li>

    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons (9g) baking soda</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon (2.8g) kosher salt</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon (2.3g) espresso powder</li>

    <li>1 cup (227g) milk (or buttermilk, almond, or coconut milk)</li>

    <li>1/2 cup (99g) vegetable oil (or canola, or melted coconut oil)</li>

    <li>2 large (100g) eggs</li>

    <li>2 teaspoons (9.4g) vanilla extract</li>

    <li>1 cup (227g) boiling water</li>

    <li>Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (recipe coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat Oven: Crank that oven up to 350º F (175º C). Prepare two 9-inch cake pans with baking spray, butter, and a light dusting of flour, or brush them with homemade chocolate pan release.</li>

    <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and espresso powder to a large bowl or stand mixer. Whisk or paddle through to combine.</li>

    <li>Combine Wet Ingredients: Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to the flour mixture. Mix on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed, and carefully add boiling water to the batter until well combined. The batter will be thin, but that's perfect for a moist cake.</li>

    <li>Bake: Distribute cake batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes. Stick a toothpick or cake tester into the center—if it comes out clean, you're good.</li>

    <li>Cool and Frost: Remove cakes from the oven, let them cool for 10 minutes, then remove from pans and cool completely. Frost the cake with that divine chocolate buttercream.</li>
</ol>
<p>Storage Tips:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make Ahead: Let cakes cool, wrap in plastic, and place each layer in a gallon zip-top freezer bag. Freeze for up to a month.</li>

    <li>To Frost: Thaw in the refrigerator with wrapping intact. Frost once completely thawed.</li>

    <li>Storage: Store at room temperature under a cake dome to keep it fresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modifications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gluten-Free: Swap in equal amounts of gluten-free flour.</li>

    <li>Dairy-Free: Use almond milk or coconut milk.</li>

    <li>Egg-Free: Substitute 2/3 cup unsweetened applesauce or Bob’s Red Mill Egg Replacer for the 2 large eggs.</li>

    <li>Butter and Oils: Use melted coconut oil or butter in place of vegetable oil for a different texture, still delicious.</li>
</ul>
<p>This chocolate cake is a masterpiece. Sweet, moist, and decadent. Get in there and make it. Your taste buds will thank you.
