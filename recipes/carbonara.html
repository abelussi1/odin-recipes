    <title>Finally Some Good F'ing Food: Carbonara</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Alright, buckle up, because we’re making Spaghetti Carbonara the right way, no shortcuts, no cream, just the good stuff. This is going to be so incredible that even Nonna would be proud.</p>

<p><strong>Spaghetti Carbonara<p></strong>

<p>No cream. Just egg, cheese, guanciale, and a splash of pasta water. 15 minutes later, you'll have perfection on a plate.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
    <li>200g guanciale (or pancetta or streaky bacon if you can't get guanciale)</li>

    <li>100g Parmigiano Reggiano, finely grated (or Pecorino Romano, or a mix of both)</li>

    <li>3 large eggs</li>

    <li>400g spaghetti</li>

    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon salt (for pasta water)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Prep the Guanciale: Cut the guanciale into thick batons. Biting through the golden brown crust into meaty bits of salty guanciale is part of the awesomeness that is carbonara!</li>

    <li>Grate Your Cheese: Finely grate the Parmigiano Reggiano. Use a microplane—it’s a lifesaver.

    <li>Make the Sauce: Whisk together the egg, cheese, and a good pinch of freshly ground black pepper in a large bowl. This is where the magic starts. Make sure the bowl is large enough to toss all the pasta in later.

    <li>Cook the Pasta: Bring 4 litres of water to a boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the spaghetti until it’s firm and just cooked through. Reserve one cup of pasta water before draining.

    <li>Cook the Guanciale: While the pasta is cooking, sauté the guanciale in a large pan over medium heat until it’s golden and crispy. No extra oil needed—the guanciale will fry in its own fat.</li>

    <li>Combine: Throw the hot pasta into the pan with the guanciale. Toss well to coat every strand with that beautiful guanciale fat. Now, tip it all into the bowl with the egg and cheese mixture. Use a rubber spatula to scrape out every last drop of guanciale fat from the pan. That’s pure gold!</li>

    <li>Mix Vigorously: Add half a cup of pasta cooking water to the bowl. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, mix vigorously, spinning the pasta around for 30 seconds to a minute. Watch as the watery pale yellow liquid transforms into a creamy sauce. The sauce should cling to the pasta, not pool in the bottom of the bowl.</li>

    <li>Serve Immediately: Serve straight away in warm bowls. Don’t wait—pasta waits for no one. Pasta is best when fresh, with the sauce slick and pasta juicy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hot Tips:<p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the handle of a wooden spoon to mix. Fast and effective.</li>

    <li>Warm bowls by microwaving for a minute, running under hot water, or keeping in a low oven.</li>
</ul>

No cheating with cream here, mate. This is the real deal, silky, creamy Carbonara as it's meant to be. Get in there and make it now, you’ll thank me later. Cheers!
