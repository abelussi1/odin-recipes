    <p>Alright, you ready to make a proper, <span style="color:red">fiery</span> gumbo, Hells Kitchen style? Let’s dive right in:</p>

        <p>Authentic New Orleans Gumbo</p>
        
        <p>This recipe is a firecracker. Made with a dark roux, fresh vegetables, chicken, sausage, and shrimp—all served over rice. Perfect for when you need something hearty.</p>
        
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, heaping</li>
        
        <li>2/3 cup vegetable or canola oil</li>
        
        <li>1 bunch celery, diced (leaves included)</li>
        
        <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
        
        <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
        
        <li>1 bunch green onions, finely chopped</li>
        
        <li>1 bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
        
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
        
        <li>1-2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning</li>
        
        <li>6-8 cups chicken broth</li>
        
        <li>12 ounces andouille sausages, sliced</li>
        
        <li>Meat from 1 rotisserie chicken</li>
        
        <li>2 cups precooked shrimp</li>
        
        <li>Cooked white rice for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Make the Roux: Get your large pot out. Combine flour and oil, cooking on medium-low. Stir constantly for 30-45 minutes. Not kidding. Watch it turn dark as chocolate, thick like dough. Don’t let it burn!</li>

        <li>Chop Those Veggies: Celery, bell pepper, onions, green onions, parsley—chop them good and fine. You want that freshness to come through in every bite.</li>

        <li>Brown the Sausage: Slice up that sausage and get it in a hot skillet. Single layer. Brown one side, then flip each slice. Nice and even.</li>

        <li>Combine in Pot: Transfer everything to your large pot. Add chicken broth, your chopped veggies, parsley, garlic, and roux. Skim any foam off the top. Stir in Cajun seasoning.</li>

        <li>Add Meat: Add your rotisserie chicken, browned sausage, and shrimp. Taste and season to your liking—more salt, pepper, chicken broth, or Cajun seasoning. The power is in your hands.

        <li>Serve: Ladle this culinary triumph over hot rice. Even better the next day after the flavors have mingled overnight. Serve with a side of homemade potato salad if you're feeling extra indulgent.</li>
</ol>
